        Title: Layout stylesheet for Google-Homepage

        Description: Part of the 'Google-Homepage' project assignment from the The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/).  The aim is to make a page that looks like the Google homepage through analyzing the page elemenents via Chrome's Developer Tools.  This stylesheet focuses on setting up the general layout of the page (ex: flexboxes, alignment, positioning).

/*  STYLESHEET
    --------------- 
    Attributes pulled from analyze the computed styles for elements (ignoring styles that come from "user agent stylesheet" since that is a stylesheet applied by the browser itself)
*/

    /* Set height and minimum width for html and body (I left out the margin:0 and padding:0 because it's already included in my reset stylesheet */
    html, body {
        min-width: 400px;
        height: 100%;
    }


    /*  CLASS AND ID BASED STYLES
        ---------------
    */

    #bodyDiv {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        height: 100%;
    }

    /* FIXME: change class name (currently grabbed from inspecting Google html and css) */
    .o3j99 {
        flex-shrink: 0;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    #topNav {
        height: 60px;
    }
