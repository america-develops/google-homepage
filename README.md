This project is part of my working through 'The Odin Project'.

The goal is to re-create the Google Homepage through HTML, CSS, and using Chrome Developer Tools to inspect elements.

The code was written in Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension installed.  Git Bash was used to commit changes and push commits to the remote repository.  Since I worked on this code across different devices, the "git pull" command was extensively used in addition to "git push".
